    This contains the java lab programs
    
 1. Write Java programs
    a. To print fibonacci series without using recursion and using recursion.(concept of loops, data
    types)
    b. To check prime numbers.
    c. To sort an array elements using bubble sort algorithm.
    
2.  Create a class called account with the data members(Accno â€“ integer, name String, Phone_No: integer, 
    balance_amt:float), and following methods :
    a. getinput() to get input from the user
    b. Deposit() method which takes the amount to be deposited in to his/her account and do the
    calculation.
    c. Withdraw() method which gets the amount to be withdrawn from his/her account.
    d. Print the appropriate results.
    
3.  Define a Stack class to implement the stack data structure. Include constructors to perform initialization,
    method push to push an element into the stack, method pop to remove an element from the stack and
    display method to display the elements of the stack.
    
4.  Define a class Complex with data members as two real numbers, constructors for initialization these
    numbers, methods to add, subtract and multiply 2 complex numbers.
    
5.  Write a java program to read 2 matrices and place the product in a third matrix . Use constructors and
    suitable methods.
    
6.  Write a java program to work with strings.
    a.  Extract a portion of the string and print it. Variable m indicates the amount of characters to
        be extracted from the string starting from the nth position.
    b. Read a text and count all the occurrences of a particular word.
    c. Replace a substring in the given string.
    d. Rearrange the string and rewrite in alphabetical order.
    e. Compare two strings ignoring case.
    f. Concatenate two strings.
