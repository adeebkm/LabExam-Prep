    This contains the java lab programs
    
 1. Write Java programs
    a. To print fibonacci series without using recursion and using recursion.(concept of loops, data
    types)
    b. To check prime numbers.
    c. To sort an array elements using bubble sort algorithm.
    
2.  Create a class called account with the data members(Accno – integer, name String, Phone_No: integer, 
    balance_amt:float), and following methods :
    a. getinput() to get input from the user
    b. Deposit() method which takes the amount to be deposited in to his/her account and do the
    calculation.
    c. Withdraw() method which gets the amount to be withdrawn from his/her account.
    d. Print the appropriate results.
    
3.  Define a Stack class to implement the stack data structure. Include constructors to perform initialization,
    method push to push an element into the stack, method pop to remove an element from the stack and
    display method to display the elements of the stack.
    
4.  Define a class Complex with data members as two real numbers, constructors for initialization these
    numbers, methods to add, subtract and multiply 2 complex numbers.
    
5.  Write a java program to read 2 matrices and place the product in a third matrix . Use constructors and
    suitable methods.
    
6.  Write a java program to work with strings.
    a.  Extract a portion of the string and print it. Variable m indicates the amount of characters to
        be extracted from the string starting from the nth position.
    b. Read a text and count all the occurrences of a particular word.
    c. Replace a substring in the given string.
    d. Rearrange the string and rewrite in alphabetical order.
    e. Compare two strings ignoring case.
    f. Concatenate two strings.

7.  Create a Personal class to hold the personal details of an person such as name, age, education, salary-
    (0basic, da, hra), years of experience, number of loans and loan amount. Write constructors to assign
    values to the data members. Include an
    a. isEligible() method to indicate whether the person is eligible for loan,
    b. taxPay() method to indicate the amount of tax to be paid,
    c. isEligiblePromotion() to indicate whether the person is eligible for a promotion.
    d. Display () method to display the details.
    Enter the details of n employees and indicate their eligibility and the tax to be paid.
    
8.  Create a Circle class with following members.
    A data member that stores the radius of a circle.
    A constructor function with an argument that initializes the radius
    A function that computes and returns area of a circle
    Create two derived classes Sector and Segment that inherit the Circle class. Both classes inherit radius and the
    function that returns the circle‟s area from Circle.    
    In addition to the members inherited from Circle, Sector and Segment have some specific members as follows:
    Sector
        1. A data member that stores the control angle of a sector (in radians)
        2. A constructor function with arguments that initialize radius and angle
        3. A function that computes and returns the area of a sector
    Segment
        1. A data member that stores the length of a segment in a circle
        2. A constructor function with arguments that initialize radius and length
        3. A function that computes and returns the area of a segment
    Create the main () function to instantiate an object of each class and then call appropriate member functions to
    compute and return the area of a circle, sector and segment. 
    Note :Area_of_circle = pi * r 2
    Area_of_Sector=(1/2) r 2 *θ
    Area_of_segment= r2*((r-h)/r) – (r-h) (2rh-h2)1/2 Where r is the radius of a circle, θ is the central angle of a
    sector in radians, h is the length of a segment and ((r-h)/r) is in radians.
